## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Visit separate links on click and see the contact form upon clicking the 'Contact Us Here' button.

### My Process

I build a basic marketing agency website to practice my homepage setup then worked on positioning my links according to a code-along tutorial. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to further establish my DOM manipulation learning, which improves every week. Then worked some more on familiarizing myself with CSS Flexbox and displaying my Responsive Navbar applying said concepts.

### Continued development

I will invest more time in JavaScript Project-related practice to understand the logic behind some JavaScript concepts applied here - including DOM Manipulation. I will proceed to practice some more Flexbox related projects and improve my layout skills.
